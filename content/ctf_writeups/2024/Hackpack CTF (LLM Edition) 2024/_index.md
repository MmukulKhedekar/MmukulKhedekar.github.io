I participated in HackPack CTF 2024 with the team <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/16691/">InfoSecIITR</a>. We finished $10$th out of the $241$ teams that participated in this competition. I'll explain the writeups for a couple of challenges (the ones that I could and the ones that were solved by others but I could understand)
