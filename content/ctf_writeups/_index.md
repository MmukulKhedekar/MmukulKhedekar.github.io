title: CTF Writeups   
---

---

I participate in CTFs with the alias `kh4rg0sh` (or `fooker` sometimes) and play for [InfoSecIITR](https://infoseciitr.in/). I will be posting the writeups for all the challenges that I solve here. Additionally, I'll also add the writeups for those challenges that I find new and informative.

I am proficient in `cryptography` and `algorithms` and have a keen interest towards learning about the workings of low-level security
