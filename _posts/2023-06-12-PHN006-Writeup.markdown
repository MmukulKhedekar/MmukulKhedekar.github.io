During this semester, I had enrolled in the course PHN006: Introduction to Quantum and Statistical Mechanics. As part of the coursework, we were required to select a topic and prepare a writeup for our course project. Intrigued by the subject, I chose to explore Potential Wells and Barriers. In my writeup, I delve into the various scenarios that generate wavefunctions. Specifically, I focus on three commonly encountered situations and thoroughly analyze the solutions of the Schroedinger's Wave equation when applied to each of them.
