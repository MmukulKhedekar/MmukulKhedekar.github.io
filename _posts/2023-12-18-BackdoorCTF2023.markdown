InfosecIITR conducted the annual CTF named "Backdoor CTF" starting from the 16th of december that lasted for a whooping 48 hours! This was the first time that I ever worked as a CTF organiser and a problemsetter on a CTF. I was kinda anxious as well excited to propose problems for this event. It's always fun to set problems on your own and let others solve it, so I tried to prepare the problems on ideas as original as it could be. Also, it had only been merely 6 months since I was recruited in InfosecIITR for handling the cryptography category. So being a beginner (and also a problemsetter) as compared to the participants that played this CTF was kinda scary. Nevertheless, I tried to look out for ideas that could make the challenges more fun to solve and informative as well. The aftermath of the problem writing phase with our team of 5 crypto problemsetters at InfosecIITR was a set of whooping 13 cryptography problems. Out of these I set 6 problems (ideas for 2 out these 6). All the cryptography problems can be found <a href="https://github.com/MmukulKhedekar/BackdoorCTF2023-Crypto">here</a>. I personally found <a href="https://connor-mccartney.github.io/cryptography/other/BackdoorCTF-2023-writeups">this</a> writeup to be really cool and concise. Apart from that, <a href="https://ctfwriteups.org/ctfs/658035f233b399e7fe20f655/edit">this</a> is a cool collection of writeups.
